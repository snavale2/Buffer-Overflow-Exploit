Programming Language: Python

------ Running the program -------

# Compile the vuln_program.c

- Compile the program
$ gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -fno-pie -no-pie -m32 -O0 -g vuln_program.c -o vuln_program


# To run the program for the attack_string

- Find the target by running
$  nm -g vuln_program

- To run the python program to get attack_string
$ python3 attack.py <target>

- To run the vulnerable C code
$ ./vuln program < attack string


# To run the program for shell_string (Bonus)

$ python3 attack.py shellcode

$ setarch `uname -m` -R ./vuln_program < shell_string

------- Explaination --------

1. Finding the address of buf in vuln_program.c
2. Finding the guess address which is the address where shell_code would be added
3. guess address = address(buf) + 0x28
4. making shell_string by appending buffer, guess address, nop, shell_code
